# Keres
## Support
> This is a role for very skilled pilots. You will need to know what to damp. Damp the wrong thing and the whole fleet dies.

### Fitting
> The highslots are offlined and used to rep during downtime. Improve this fit by abyssaling prop, maybe repper for cap. If you have armor logi in fleet, you can swap the repper for more tank. Storyline damps are very good.
